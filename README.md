Assessment done with React Native (Expo)

## Push Mobile App

### QUESTION ATTEMPTED By Ihonosetale Oseghale

### DESCRIPTION

- The challenge was to build a mobile app that displays and showcases the **DeGod NFT collections.**

- The NFT collection includes around 8943 different items(NFTs).

- The first 20 NFTs are fetched by default for this demonstration.

### HOW I WOULD IMPROVE THIS FURTHER

- Right now, the first 20 NFTs are fetched by default, this can be further improved by the pagination allowance, so that when the user gets to the bottom of the list, the app should auto-fetch new NFTs to display

```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
npm install
